    Fill TODO-s in the code according to provided instructions.
    Each solution should be in a single line if not stated otherwise.

    This script should be execution from VSCode.
    PowerShell and VSCode should be installed in proper directories.
    First tests check those assumptions.
    No other instances of PowerShell or Notepad should be started.
    If they fail, fix them first!
